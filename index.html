    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The wind was howling through the trees and the game was afoot. A terrible mournful howl broke over the sound of the wind. What could it be?</p>
    <p>A NAKED WEREWOLF</p>
    <p>OMG a metrosexual werewolf wearing only his manse and an embarrassed look</p>
    <p>He runs into the nearest home to grab a scarf and some skinny jeans</p>
    <p>Do these jeans make my bum look fat he asks as he gazes lovingly into the mirror.</p>
